This code will output:

min = -10; // minimum value
max = 50; // maximum value
amp = Math.abs(max-min)/2; // amount to wiggle
offset = (max+min)/2;
wiggle(8, amp) + offset;

Where wiggle is an expression from extendscript and x and y are the the parameters:
x: the frequency at which a frame wiggles
y: the distance that the frame wiggles

The default position of a 2D frame is 360,640 so the expression will make a frame move between the range of 630 to 
690 vertically and 350 to 410 horizontally.

If the freq_q is anything besides sec, we can change the frequency by multiplication/division

directions = [x, y] // the frame can wiggle in both the 
freq_type (sec) // the frame can wiggle a freq number of times per freq_type
wiggle in range(-10, 50): // the frame can move 50 pixels positively and 10 pixels negatively in all the directions in directions
    freq = 8 // the frame can wiggle 8 times per freq_type
