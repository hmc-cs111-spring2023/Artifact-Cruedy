This code will output:

min = -10; // minimum value
max = 50; // maximum value
amp = Math.abs(max-min)/2; // amount to wiggle
offset = (max+min)/2;
wiggle(8, a) + offset;

Where wiggle is an expression from extendscript and x and y are the the parameters:
x: the frequency at which a frame wiggles
y: the distance that the frame wiggles

So the above expression will move the frame in a range of 100 pixels in any direction

wiggle in range(100):
    freq = 8
