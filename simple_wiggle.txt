This code will output:

wiggle(8, 100)

Where wiggle is an expression from extendscript and x and y are the the parameters:
x: the frequency at which a frame wiggles per second
y: the distance that the frame wiggles

The default position of a 2D frame is 360,640 so the expression will make a frame move between the range of 540 to 
740 vertically and 260 to 460 horizontally.

So the above expression will move the frame in a range of 50 pixels in any direction

directions = [x, y] // the frame can wiggle in both the 
freq_type (sec) // the frame can wiggle a freq number of times per freq_type
// if the freq_q is anything besides sec, we can change the frequency by multiplication/division
wiggle in range(-50, 50): // the frame can move 50 pixels in all the directions in directions
    freq = 8 // the frame can wiggle 8 times per freq_type
