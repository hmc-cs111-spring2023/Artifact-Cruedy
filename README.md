_Example code in my DSl are in the `files` folder which is inside of the `DSL Code` folder._

_To run the parser, scroll to the bottom of `parser.py` to where the `parser()` function is called and change the input file *the first parameter* to the .txt file that you've written your code in and the output file *the second parameter* to the .jsx file that you want to output._
